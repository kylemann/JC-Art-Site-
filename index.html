            <p class="art-name">Artist</p>
        
        <p class="art-dsc" ><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Jorge Luis Caceres was born in Lima,Peru in 1978.</span> His multi-cultural background gives him the unique ability to convey his creativity through painting. As a  self-taught artist, He expresses himself by combining abstract pieces of different colors and shapes.</p>

            <p>He studied Architecture at one of Lima's most renowned universities</span> but found himself being drawn to the freedom that painting offered him. He participated in several art competitions and won third place for one particular work of a city landmark. The painting was highly acclaimed and was featured in a local newspaper.</p>

            <p>Jorge finds his country to be a big source of inspiration.</span> His extensive travels to different cities such as Arequipa and Cuzco particularly reflect those cultural influences in his artwork. His visits to the ruins of Machu-Picchu exposed him to the wonderfully organic shapes and the views offered by this wonder of the world.</p>

            <p>In 2001 he moved to Washington DC where he currently resides.</span> He has been commissioned to paint private collections and has shown his paintings in galleries such as, Touchstone Gallery, among various others.</p>
